<p>As more people turn to freelancing, whether by choice or find themselves in it - are businesses also thinking about the seismic shift that's going to happen, or are they lagging behind, and might struggle to make the most of it?<br><br>We know we will see more project driven work, over open-ended employment. We will see specialists draughted in-to augment teams, over in-house training. We will see a redefining of the idea of "retention" to include trusted collaborators, not just employees. <br><br>Over the next few months, I'm going to be having a number of conversations with businesses who are ahead of the curve, to explore how they are approaching the new models of work, and businesses who want to lean into this new way of working.</p><p>I&#8217;ll also be speaking to organisations, communities, influencers, platforms and policy makers to explore their role in supporting the freelance economy - to understand how they play a role, and see what the future might hold.<br><br>We&#8217;ll be talking to three groups - hirers, communities and influencers.<br><br><strong>Cohort 1: Hirers</strong></p><p>In the first season of Freelancers Wanted, we're talking to the businesses who have actively decided to make freelancers a core part of their business. Not bolt-ons, not seat-filling, but a strategic decision to embrace collaborating with independent workers.</p><p>Whether they're agencies, collectives, brands or something different - we'll hear why they're making this choice, what they look for in their partners, the challenges they're facing, and the benefits they're seeing.</p><p>&#187; If you&#8217;re working with freelancers in a different way &#8230; <a href="https://theindependencyco.typeform.com/fr-wanted-pod">let us know about your organisation</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Cohort 2: Communities</strong></p><p>In the second season of Freelancers Wanted, we're talking to the individuals, groups and communities that are actively supporting freelancers. We'll be speaking to each of the members of the Independency Community Coalition.</p><p>Why they were setup, how they help freelancers, the challenges they hear freelancers are facing, and their views on what needs to change.</p><p>&#187; If you&#8217;re a community host, <a href="https://the.independency.co/community-coalition">apply to join the Coalition</a></p><p></p><p><strong>Cohort 3: Influencers, Policymakers and Experts</strong></p><p>In the third season of Freelancers Wanted, we're speaking to individuals and organisations who are actively shaping the landscape for the support and engagement of freelancers - whether they're influential voices, changing government policies, developing research, or simply changing attitudes.</p><p>We'll be discussing the shape of freelancing today and tomorrow, what needs to change, and what we can all do to make a difference.</p><p><strong><br>Plus the voice of the freelancer ...</strong></p><p>Within each episode, we'll also be hearing from freelancers themselves, responding to the themes, questions and answers discussed so far.</p><p></p><p><em>If you&#8217;re keen to be involved in the project, drop me a note (just hit reply), or <a href="https://theindependencyco.typeform.com/fr-wanted-pod">leave your details here</a>.
