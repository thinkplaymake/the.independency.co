<p><strong><a href="https://www.weareallmarketing.com/">We Are All Marketing</a></strong> is a new breed of agency. </p><p>A curated network of marketing freelancers: experienced, passionate and agile. A tight-knit family of experts; each with their own skills, views and specialisms. Their dynamic, freelance model means clients only pay for the services they need - no expensive overheads, just an extensive network of trusted partners, that has been built and collaborated with effectively for a long time.</p><p>But when your freelancers are your business model, understanding how your network feels about working with you, is essential. It can be hard to ask directly for feedback - as freelancers might often worry negative comments might lead to less work in the future.</p><p>So when we spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriascally/">Victoria Scally</a>, founder of WAAM, about an independent review of their community experience, she jumped at the opportunity.</p><p>After running the impartial audit, and producing an in-depth report, combining qualitative and quantitative insights, Victoria has been able to start planning for 2026, and identified where they can continue to make improvements and build an even stronger network and community of partners.<br></p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/weareallmarketing/">We Are All Marketing</a></strong> is a business that, at almost 6 years old, can't keep going the way we started, and the main sources for designing for growth has to come from within the community we've built. But one thing remains true - transparency.&#8221;<br><br>So when the opportunity to work with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinkplaymake/">Matthew Knight</a></strong> to undertake an independent review of our community's experience of working with us, I ran at it! <br><br>The insights we received have helped us shape, sharpen and plan to build for a stronger future for WAAM, so huge end of 2025 thanks to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinkplaymake/">Matthew</a></strong> so much for running this for us, I'm excited for what's next as a result of the feedback. <br><br>Freelancers are the future, our business is built on this principle, and so making sure we're delivering the best possible experience (and a tonne of learnings for how to make it better), ready for growth.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><em>If you&#8217;re keen to run an impartial report on your freelancer network, <a href="mailto:hello@independency.co">get in touch</a> or <a href="https://the.independency.co/feedback">find out more</a>.</em></p>
