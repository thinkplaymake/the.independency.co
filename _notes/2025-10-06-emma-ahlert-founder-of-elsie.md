She then moved to Edinburgh to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in the sociology of emotion, &#8220;with a focus on how access to sex education as young people impacts our emotional health in adulthood and how comprehensive sex ed is actually a human right because it sets us up in a lot of ways moving forward with boundaries and communication.&#8221;</p><p>While in Edinburgh, Emma became deeply involved in grassroots campaigning for anti-harassment buffer zones around abortion clinics in Scotland. &#8220;Actually, that campaigning experience is where I got my first freelance job, which was doing social media for a big tampon company in London.&#8221; Over the next couple of years, she built a portfolio of around 10 brands spanning bladder care, period care, gut health, and menopause &#8212; all through word of mouth.</p><h2>The Birth of Elsie</h2><p>Emma&#8217;s path to entrepreneurship was unconventional. &#8220;In 2021, I was put in a very strange position in the UK where my degree had finished and I needed to either get a full-time job, start a business or move home, and it was completely covid so there was nobody hiring.&#8221; She chose to start a business despite never having freelanced before, initially launching a generalist platform before pivoting to focus on female and sexual healthcare.</p><p>Today, Elsie &#8212; named after a Scottish suffragette who started the first Women&#8217;s Health Hospital in Edinburgh &#8212; is her community for people who work in the sector, &#8220;building on all the pain points that I learned building my portfolio in the space.&#8221;</p><h2>A Global Community Addressing Unique Challenges</h2><p>The female and sexual healthcare sector is &#8220;super, super underfunded&#8212;it gets about 2% of VC funding,&#8221; Emma explains. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a kind of disproportionate reliance on freelance, part-time, flexible contract work.&#8221; Combined with taboo and censorship issues, this creates sector-specific pain points that general freelance communities can&#8217;t fully address.</p><p>What started with uncertain expectations has grown into a truly international community with members from over 15 countries. &#8220;People say that female sexual healthcare is niche, when actually I think it&#8217;s probably one of the most commonly pervasive topics that affects everybody.&#8221;</p><p>Emma built the community around three core pain points: &#8220;Trouble finding work, trouble building community, and lack of sector-specific upskilling.&#8221; Members get access to constantly updated channels of jobs, gigs, industry events, and research opportunities, along with monthly webinars and both virtual and in-person networking events.</p><h2>More Than Just Business</h2><p>Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Elsie is its impact on members&#8217; emotional wellbeing. After going through a major breakup in Edinburgh, Emma found herself alone in the city. &#8220;The only way that I made every single friend that I have is I went to every single networking event I could find on related topics I cared about, and I went up to people and asked them if they would like to be my friend.&#8221;</p><p>This personal experience shaped her vision for Elsie as something more than transactional. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want it to be just a job board or somewhere you visit and you get a gig and then you leave. I think there&#8217;s a direct correlation between the strength of our community and the sustainability of our business.&#8221;</p><p>Six months in, Emma conducted a survey asking what shouldn&#8217;t change as Elsie grows. &#8220;People said the way that it makes me feel. I did a sentence that said how I felt before Elsie and how I feel now that I&#8217;m here, and most people all over the world free wrote: before Elsie I felt alone and now I feel seen.&#8221;</p><p>Her hope for members is clear: &#8220;I love having that idea if you&#8217;ve got a place that no matter what happens with your work, you&#8217;re always welcome back at this space. I hope it gives you more gigs and I hope it teaches you new things, but at the end of the day, I hope you know you always get a response and there&#8217;s always somebody here if you need anything.&#8221;</p><div><hr></div><p><em>To learn more about <strong>Elsie</strong> or join the community, visit <a href="https://veryelsie.com">veryelsie.com</a> or find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-ahlert/?originalSubdomain=uk">Emma Ahlert on LinkedIn.</a></em></p>
