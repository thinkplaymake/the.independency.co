# Elsie

Elsie is the first global community designed for freelancers working in female and sexual healthcare. We are "freelance-focussed" in our content/courses (being developed) but I accept full-timers as well. Given how tumultuous FemTech and SexTech funding is, there are many people who are full-time going freelance, freelance going full-time, full-time with a side-hustle and more. My main objective is to gather people who work in and care about this space and are looking for a low cost, long term way to build a sustainable network.
