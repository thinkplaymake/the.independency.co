# NUJ London Freelance Branch

London Freelance Branch is the National Union of Journalists' largest grouping, with more than 3500 members. Its members work as freelances - not just reporters and photographers, but sub-editors, designers, and all other kinds of journalist. Some are between staff jobs, and many others join the Branch to organise alongside colleagues who want to be freelance.
