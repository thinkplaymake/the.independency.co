# Freelancing For Good

Freelancing For Good is a supportive Slack community for freelancers who want to use their business to make a positive impact. It's a space to connect, collaborate, and share aligned opportunities.

Some of our members work directly on causes like climate, animal welfare, or mental health. Others focus on impact through donations, or are still figuring out what "freelancing for good" means for them. We recognise that everyone's business and situation is different, so we aim to keep the space inclusive, supportive, and open to all paths to impact.
