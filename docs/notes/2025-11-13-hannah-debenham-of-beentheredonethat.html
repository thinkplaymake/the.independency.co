        <p>We&#8217;ve recently been working with the team at <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/btdt-global/">BeenThereDoneThat</a></strong> to help them better understand their relationship with their network of experts.<br /><br />They&#8217;re a super smart business: lean focused core, plus a curated group of world-class creative, strategic, marketing and insight specialists, who they bring together to deliver work for brands like Disney, LEGO, Google, Accenture.<br /><br />So fostering strong relationships with those independent collaborators is essential, especially when it&#8217;s wrapped up into your core proposition.<br /></p>
<blockquote><p>Working with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinkplaymake/">Matthew Knight</a></strong> to run a feedback, experience and reputation audit on our network of collaborators has proved just how transformative great feedback can be.</p><p>As a business built on the strength of our expert network, having an honest assessment of our talent pool is essential.</p><p><strong>The Independency Co.</strong>&#8216;s impartial study produced a rich report detailing gaps, risks, and actionable insights. </p><p>Now, as we gear up for annual planning, it&#8217;s helped us rethink how we shape and nurture our network based on the feedback that was shared.</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re studio, agency, collective, recruiter, platform, or something there&#8217;s not a label for yet... Our impartial audit helps any business who has a network of freelancers or collaborators identify where they&#8217;re doing brilliantly, and where there&#8217;s room for improvement - replacing anecdote or instinct with data and evidence. <br /><br />So when you&#8217;re planning next year, you can have confidence in your pool - or a project plan to make sure your pool is still engaged, active and ready to deliver award winning work with you.</p>
