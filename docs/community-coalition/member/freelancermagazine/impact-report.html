            <strong>Freelancer Magazine is a quarterly print+digital magazine and membership for marketing, creative and B2B freelancers.</strong><br/><br/>

    <h3 id="intentions-for-2025">Intentions for 2025</h3>
<p>In 2025, our goals were to create more connections between our freelance members and to connect our members with clients.</p>

<h3 id="successes-in-delivering-on-those-intentions">Successes in delivering on those intentions</h3>

<p>Delivered 150 two-hour morning virtual coworking sessions.</p>

<p>Partnered with other in-person events, including ATOMICON, Creator Day, Ne’Twerking, and Cowork Crew to connect our members IRL.</p>

<p>Launched our online Find a Freelancer Directory (now featuring 525 freelancers) and made 2000 copies of a mini print version, which was distributed at agencies and business events.</p>

<h3 id="community-voices">Community voices</h3>

<blockquote>
“Celie Nigoumi’s business manager found me in the Directory and encouraged her to contact me. Which led to a virtual meet-up, and we just vibed and started working together. So thank you to Freelancer Mag for getting my face and details out there, so that I can meet incredible people like Celie.”

<blockquote>"Proud to say I've been a subscriber since Issue 1, and it gets better and better every time! If you're a freelancer, do yourself a favour and sign up today. You'll get many times the sub back in great ideas, fresh perspectives and mutually beneficial connections, all wrapped up inside a warm and welcoming community of lovely people. I can't recommend the work that Sophie and her crew do highly enough."​</blockquote>

<h3 id="one-thing-im-incredibly-proud-of">One thing I’m incredibly proud of</h3>
<p>I’m proud that we’ve grown so much that in 2026, our new Editor, Joanna Cummings, is starting, which means we can have a dedicated resource to look after the freelance community and marketing (me!).</p>

<h3 id="one-thing-im-looking-to-do-next-year">One thing I’m looking to do next year</h3>
<p>In March 2026, we’re hosting Freelancer Masterclass LIVE for the first time. A two-day virtual event where freelancers can connect and ‘peer over the shoulder’ of freelance business experts in workshops with immediately actionable, practical takeaways, whether your goals are growing your community, getting more sales or scaling your business.</p>
