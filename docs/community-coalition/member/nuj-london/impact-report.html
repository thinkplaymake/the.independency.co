           <strong>NUJ London Freelance Branch:</strong> Impact Report 2025

            <strong>London Freelance Branch is the National Union of Journalists' largest grouping, with more than 3500 members</strong><br/><br/>

            We asked each of our members to share their community impact during 2025. <a href="/community-coalition/impact-report">See all reports here.</a></p>

<p>In early April, Chair Pennie Quinton led our branch delegation to the NUJ Delegate Meeting in Blackpool, where all LFB motions were approved by the delegates, apart from one motion which we agreed to remit to the NEC. Thanks to all the LFB branch delegates for their dedicated service: Juliet Davies, Mariam Elsayeh, Helen Hague, Owen Holdaway, Nika Talbot, Tony Levene, and Susan Wallace: and thanks again to Tim Gopsill for getting everything ready for the delegate meeting.</p>

<p>At the Branch meeting on 14 July we heard from NUJ General Secretary Laura Davison and Financial Times Parent of Chapel Steve Bird on freelance organising for better rates of pay.</p>

<p>On 27 July we held a branch summer social and picnic in St James's Park, where we herded deckchairs and whiled away a beautiful Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>We held an emergency LFB committee meeting to discuss our response Israeli forces deploying an airstrike on the press tent outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, where we were joined by John McDonnell and Peter Oborne – and organised a vigil on Wednesday 13 August opposite Downing Street. The 13 August vigil was addressed by NUJ general secretary Laura Davison, John McDonnell, LFB training officer Mariam Elsayeh and LFB chair Pennie Quinton. Journalists held placards, each bearing the name of a journalist killed in Gaza and read out their names one by one.</p>

<p>The branch on 27 August delivered a branch to the Prime Minister with an addendum on the most recent killings. The letter was co-signed by the NUJ’s London Central Branch; London Magazine Branch; London Digital Media Branch; officials of the Financial Times Group Chapel; Brussels Branch; Ethics Council and Photographers’ Council. It was also supported by Khaled Shalaby, head of video operations for Middle East Eye – who had seen his colleague Ahmed Abu Aziz killed at Nasser Hospital just two days previously; and by Sarah Beddington, writer and director of Fadia’s Tree, an award-winning film about Palestinian exile. The letter demanded to know what actual action the Prime Minster will take to address the mass killing of journalists.</p>

<p>In early September I attended Trades Union Congress as one of the elected delegates representing the NUJ at TUC – where I spoke in support of motions calling for measures to address low pay and poor conditions for freelances.</p>
