            <div class="content">
                <p>Freelancers can often seem like they come at a price premium - but the value which working with freelancers brings can deliver higher ROI per project than a full time employee.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s zero downtime, zero overheads, it&#39;s exactly the right person for the job, and independents are committed to doing work for you - if you create the right ways of working with your freelancers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all too often, businesses neglect to put the correct structures in place, creating inefficiencies in finding, hiring, onboarding, briefing, collaborating, paying and maintaining relationships with trusted freelancers - making working with external independents more costly and less productive.&nbsp;</p><p>This inefficiency is often hidden - the best freelancers navigate the hurdles and gaps in order to deliver the best work they can, despite the cost and time savings more effective practices would deliver.&nbsp;</p><p>These gaps normally arise in organisations where there is little or no defined process for engaging freelancers - perhaps working with freelancers happens too infrequently to make it seem necessary; often it comes from rushing - and having little time to adequately support the external contractors; it can come from an incorrect understanding of how IR35 works or simply - no-one internally having time or knowing what might be useful.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As freelancers become more central and integrated to how businesses deliver work - not having policies and processes in place can lead to higher costs, longer timelines, lower quality work, or even an inability to hire freelancers again - 96% of freelancers would actively avoid working for clients who didn&#39;t support them to do their best work.</p><p>But where to start? What does it take to get the best from your freelancers, or build a network of trusted collaborators you can call upon?</p><p><br></p><p>The first step is an audit - to take stock of where you are today, what gaps and inefficiencies exist, and set a clear ambition for what your freelancer network could do for you.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, laser focus on removing hurdles and filling the strategic capability gaps makes your network robust and ready to activate.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a nurture and activation programme to grow your network and bring it closer to the heart of your business.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It won&#39;t be an overnight change - but investing in working better together with your extended network of talent delivers benefits beyond just cost.</p>
