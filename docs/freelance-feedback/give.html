                <strong>
                    Less than 10% of clients ask their freelancers for feedback - we're here to encourage them to listen.
                </strong>
            </p>


            <p>
               The Independency Co. has built a platform to support freelancers to be heard by their clients.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                Leave your feedback, and we'll connect with your client, to let them know freelancers want to share their thoughts.
            </p>

            <p>It's entirely anonymous, so your relationship with your client is protected.</p>
            
            <p>
                We'll invite them to run a full feedback process, to gather insights from all of their freelancers.
            </p>

            <p>If they're not interested in listening, we'll publish anonymised data via our community network, once there's enough feedback to aggregate useful insights.</p>

            


            <h3>How do we use your data?</h3>
            <p>When you complete the feedback form - we'll anonymise your feedback, and the client know there's feedback waiting to be shared.</p>
            <p>If they choose to run a full feedback process, your feedback will be included in the report.</p>
            <p>If we have enough feedback on the same client, we'll publish the aggregated scores via our community network, so others understand common issues or success with this client.</p>
            <p>If they don't run a feedback process, we'll store your data for 12 months, and aggregate with any other feedback on the same client.</p>
            <p>Read the <a href="/freelance-feedback/open-feedback-privacy-policy">full privacy policy here</a>.</p>


            <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
            <p>The goal is to encourage clients to actively ask for feedback from their freelacers - so they can listen, learn and improve their ways of working with their partners.</p>
            <p>Our belief is that clients will benefit from knowing where there are issues, especially if it means they're losing money or efficiencies.</p>
            <p>And that's what will lead to improvements for freelancers, and better working relationships.</p>

            <h3>I'm a client, and want to listen to my freelancers!</h3>
            <p>Amazing - <a href="mailto:hello@independency.co">get in touch</a>, and we'll help you run a full feedback process, including any feedback that's been shared here.</p>
