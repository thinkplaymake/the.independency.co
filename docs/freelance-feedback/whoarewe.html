                Fewer than 1 in 10 freelancers are ever asked how their work experience could be improved. That’s not good enough.

        <h2>One of your clients is trying to change that – by listening.</h2>

        <div class="col-left">
            
            <p>They’ve partnered with us at The Independency Co. to run an independent, anonymous survey of their freelancer community – including you.</p>
            <p>By taking part, you’ll help your client understand what it’s really like to work with them – what works, what doesn’t, and where they can do better. Your insights feed directly into a confidential report we create for them, helping shape better ways of working for freelancers like you.</p>
            <p>We're not just looking for positive feedback – we want to know what’s not working, and what they can do to improve. Your honest answers will help them make things better for everyone.</p>
            
        </div>

       

        <h2>What do you do with my responses?</h2>

        <div class="col-left">
            
            <p>We'll gather your response, along with all of the other freelancers this business works with, anonymise the data, aggregate the results, and create a report.</p>
            <p>This will show them where they're doing well, and where they can improve. It will also aim to show any money they're losing by not doing a good job. And showing a commercial loss usually encourages businesses to make improvements.</p>
            <p>When you've completed the survey, we keep the anonymised data for 18 months, so if the client runs feedback again, we can compare the results.</p>
            <p>But your contact details are not stored as part of this, so there's no way for us to email or contact you.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>If its anonymous, why do you ask for my email address?</h2>

        <div class="col-left">
            
            <p>We need to verify that you are a member of this client's freelancer community. This client has provided us with a 'hashed' list of email addresses, which we compare your email address to.</p>
            <p>We delete your email address from our database four weeks after the survey closes, and the client will never be able to see a connection between your responses and your email address.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What if I'm not happy to take part?</h2>

        <div class="col-left">
            
            <p>There's no obligation to take part. It won't affect your work or relationship with this client.</p>
            <p>But we would encourage you to take part, as it will help the client improve their relationship with you, and the experience you have of working with them.</p>
            <p>If you'd prefer to share your feedback via other means, you can email us directly at <a href="mailto:hello@independency.co">hello@independency.co</a></p>
            <p>You can read our privacy policy regarding the use of your email address and the anonymised data we collect from you at <a href="https://theindependencyco.notion.site/Freelance-Feedback-via-The-Independency-Co-Privacy-Policy-206f47af4c5380d6a567fda1b5002d11?source=copy_link">here</a></p>
