        <h3>Cohort 1: Hirers</h3>
        <p>In the first season of Freelancers Wanted, we're talking to the businesses who have actively decided to make freelancers a core part of their business. Not bolt-ons, not seat-filling, but a strategic decision to embrace collaborating with independent workers.</p>
        <p>Whether they're agencies, collectives, brands or something different - we'll hear why they're making this choice, what they look for in their partners, the challenges they're facing, and the benefits they're seeing.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://theindependencyco.typeform.com/fr-wanted-pod">Let us know about your organisation</a></p>

    <div class="inner" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
        <h3>Cohort 2: Communities</h3>
        <p>In the second season of Freelancers Wanted, we're talking to the individuals, groups and communities that are actively supporting freelancers. We'll be speaking to each of the members of the Independency Community Coalition.</p>
        <p>Why they were setup, how they help freelancers, the challenges they hear freelancers are facing, and their views on what needs to change.</p>

        <h3>Cohort 3: Influencers, Policymakers and Experts</h3>
        <p>In the third season of Freelancers Wanted, we're speaking to individuals and organisations who are actively shaping the landscape for the support and engagement of freelancers - whether they're influential voices, changing government policies, developing research, or simply changing attitudes.</p>
        <p>We'll be discussing the shape of freelancing today and tomorrow, what needs to change, and what we can all do to make a difference.</p>

    <div class="inner" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
       <h3>Plus the voice of the freelancer ... </h3>
       <p>Within each episode, we'll also be hearing from freelancers themselves, responding to the themes, questions and answers discussed so far.</p>
