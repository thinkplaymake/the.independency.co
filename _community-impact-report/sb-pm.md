### Intentions for 2025
I launched SB PM Network in April 2025. My goal was 1,000 members by the end of the year and we are very close to hitting that goal.

The community is free and, up until now, have not monetised it. Though the network directly helped source a permanent candidate which led to a
placement and a number of freelance hires over summer. So whilst the community isn’t monetised directly, it’s a great addition to SB Digital Search.

### Successes in delivering on those intentions

4 successful in-person meet ups which where filmed and advertised on LinkedIn

Building a solid pool of delivery talent ready for when SB Digital Search has a requirement


### Community voices

<blockquote>"SB PM Network has made my job search feel more connected and less frustrating."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not just a network but a great sense of community to help one another."​</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Highly recommend it to anyone looking to build skills and real connections in the project management world."</blockquote>

### One thing I’m incredibly proud of
The amount of peer-to-peer learning and members are happy to volunteer for guest speaker appearances. The events really make the network what it is, which isn’t just a place to look for work but a place to upskill and be connected to like-minded people.


### One thing I’m looking to do next year
The plan is to engage with 10 paying partners, who add value to members
