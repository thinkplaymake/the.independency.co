### Intentions for 2025
In 2025, my intention with Elsie was to make it easier for people working in female and sexual health to find each other, collaborate, and build sustainable freelance careers in a sector that’s commonly underfunded but impacts everyone. That meant:

* Creating a thoughtful, values-aligned, sector-specific community
* Making it easier to find jobs and collaborators
* Prioritising quality and trust over scale

### Successes in delivering on those intentions

Members used the community to connect beyond the platform, meeting up while travelling, attending industry events together, co-hosting events, guesting on each other's podcasts.

Members regularly passed each other’s names along for roles, projects, and collaborations, reflecting a strong culture of trust and mutual support.

Several members found paid work directly through the jobs channel, reinforcing Elsie’s role as a practical resource for finding opportunities.

### Community voices

<blockquote>
“Elsie! Emma Ahlert is building the best, coziest – and frankly, coolest – community for freelancers in female + sexual health, and I want to give everyone there the biggest hug all of the time.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I found my current role through the Elsie platform, and I’m so grateful I did. It’s such a valuable space for sexual and reproductive health professionals — supportive, well-curated, and full of genuine opportunities to make an impact. Emma’s energy and professionalism are making a noticeable difference across the sector; Elsie has become a real connector for purpose-driven work in this field.”</blockquote>

### One thing I’m incredibly proud of
.....is how international the community has become. It’s important to me that people working in this sector have context beyond their immediate surroundings, and can connect with others who understand the work from different cultural, geographic, and professional perspectives. The international aspect of Elsie is something I care deeply about and am committed to maintaining as the community grows.

### One thing I’m looking to do next year
Next year, I want to:

* Delegate more to members
* Host in-person meet-ups in Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Paris
* Launch additional tools and resources to support collaboration and work-finding
