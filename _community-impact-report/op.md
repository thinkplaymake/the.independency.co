### Intentions for 2025
Grow the size of our community; Provide more opportunities for members; Develop a programme of huddles and meetups

### Successes in delivering on those intentions

Community has grown to around 900 core members, and 4k in our extended network, with growing engagment across multiple channels.

We've shared 500+ jobs in 2025, including 36 from friends including Kraft Heinz, AKQA, Ogilvy, Publicis, Asahi, Vayner, and Stink.

We hosted eight huddles; including sessions on AI, mental health, developing propositions, and creativity.

We started a new subtack, and have posted every single week this year!

### Community voices

<blockquote>
“This is one of the very best communities of strategic talent out there - incredibly diverse, collaborative and energetic.  If you are strategist, it's a great place to find your tribe.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A super-welcoming space for independent strategy folk to gather, scheme, and share opportunities. Since joining, I've had a few paid projects working with awesome people I met here. But it's the interesting reads, useful resources, and sense of being plugged into an insanely powerful hivemind that keeps me checking in every day"​</blockquote>
<cite>Joel Stein</cite>

<blockquote>"I don't know what i'd do without Outside Perspective. No matter what kind of strategist we're looking for, they seem to have the ideal candidate. I can't thank them enough"​</blockquote>

### One thing I’m incredibly proud of
We've helped countless people find work over the past 12 months, and getting positive feedback from both freelancers and hirers.

### One thing I’m looking to do next year
2026 will be about making the project sustainable, by finding partners who want to support the work and their freelancers - building a more effective ecosystem, and enabling us to do more for our members. I'm keen to invest more time in events and sharing the brilliant skills of our members with each other.
