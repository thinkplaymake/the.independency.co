**<a href="https://leapers.co/">Leapers</a> is the UK’s leading authority on mental health and freelancing**. 

Our insight into what helps freelancers work well is used across industries to inform policy, shape resources, and support healthier ways of working. To date, Leapers has supported more than 250,000 freelancers — directly through our community work, and indirectly via organisations such as Mind UK and NABS.

We’re now expanding our research to explore the relationship between freelancers and the organisations that hire them — identifying the biggest challenges, where friction occurs, and the improvements that benefit both sides.

In 2026, we’ll publish a report outlining the key drivers of an effective freelancer–client relationship: the conditions that lead to improved productivity, reduced cost, stronger relationships, higher-quality outcomes, and more sustainable working practices. We’ll also define the “Freelance Friendly” behaviours that create mutual benefit for both hirer and freelancer.

For the first phase of this research, we are inviting contributions from organisations that work with freelancers and would like to help shape more sustainable industry-wide standards.

### What’s involved?

A 30-minute online call and a pre-call questionnaire.


#### We’ll ask about:

* how you work with freelancers today;

* the challenges you experience with engagement, retention and delivery;

* the approaches you use to support freelancers between projects;

* how you understand the ROI and value of working with freelancers;

* and your reaction to a potential support model we are exploring.

### How will the research be used?

Individual responses will remain anonymous.
Findings will be aggregated into a published report highlighting:

* consistent challenges;

* successful behaviours that strengthen freelancer–hirer relationships;

* and practical steps that improve outcomes on both sides.

Insights will also inform the development of ongoing resources and support platforms for freelancers (e.g. leapers.co, freelancing.support) and new tools for hirers.

If you are open to it, “Freelance Friendly” organisations demonstrating exemplary behaviours may be quoted in the report.

### What can we offer in return?

As a thank you for taking part, we’re offering discounted access to either:

* **Poolside** — our community support platform for freelancers, including peer-support, resources, mental health toolkits, discounts and events; or

* **Freelance Feedback programme** — providing qualitative and quantitative insight into your existing freelancer relationships and reputation.

Discounts will be capped at a maximum value of £1,000.
