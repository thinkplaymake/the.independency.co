            <h3>What happens next?</h3>
            <p>We'll reach out to the client you've provided feedback on, to let them know their freelancers are keen to share.</p>

            <p>We'll highlight any key points we've heard from your feedback, as well as any feedback from other freelancers.</p>

            <p>And we encourage them to run a full feedback process - where we work with the client to speak to their entire pool of freelancers.</p>

            <p>We'll store your feedback for 12 months, and aggregate with any other feedback on the same client.</p>

            <p>Once we have enough feedback on a client, we'll publish the aggregated scores via our community network - so if you're already a member of a freelancing community - ask if they're part of the Independency Community Coalition.</p>

            <p>Our goal here is to get clients to take feedback and freelance experience seriously - and most importantly to make improvements.</p>

            <p>It's going to take some time, but we're committed to supporting you as a freelancer, and that means tackling the client-side challenges.</p>
            
            <p>If you've got any questions, drop me a note at <a href="mailto:hello@independency.co">hello@independency.co</a>.</p>
