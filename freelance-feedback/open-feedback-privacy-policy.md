* Your written feedback across a number of factors

We do not collect special category or sensitive data.

## How we use your data

We collect and process your data:

* With your consent, to support anonymous freelancer feedback

* To anonymise and aggregate your responses for use in client reports or public insights

* To store your feedback for up to 12 months in case further submissions are received about the same client

* If you opt-in, to send you occasional updates (up to 3 years)


## How we store and process it

Your data is securely stored using:

* Typeform (for data collection)

* Airtable, Google Sheets, Dropbox (for processing and storage)

* Make.com (for workflow automation)

All data is stored according to each platformâ€™s terms. No third-party sub-processors are used.

## Sharing your data
We do not share raw feedback or personal details with clients.

Only anonymised, aggregated feedback is ever shared.

If a client commissions a full feedback report, your anonymised responses may be included.

## How long we keep your data
* Raw feedback: 12 months

* Email addresses (if subscribed): up to 3 years

You may request deletion at any time (see below)

## Your rights
You have the right to:

* Request access to or deletion of your data

Because feedback is anonymised after collection, we may not always be able to identify your specific entry unless you contact us from the same email you submitted with.

## Cookies      
The feedback form is hosted via Typeform, which may set functional cookies. These are required to ensure the form works correctly. We do not use tracking cookies.
