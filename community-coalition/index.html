           From generalist groups to specific capabilities and verticals, there are groups for new freelancers, established freelancers, those who identify with certain cultures and identities, those for people are are nomadic, those who specialise in certain industries, for parents, for coffee drinkers, for everyone.

           But individually, there's only so much we can do. 
           
           Yes, we can support our members, provide resources and opportunities, but we can't do everything.

           <strong style="font-size: 120%">That's where the Independency Community Coalition comes in.</strong>

           We're a group of freelancers, who are passionate about supporting each other, and creating a better future for freelancing.

           Sharing insights, actions, objectives and opportunities - all for the benefit of our collective communities.
