Far too many businesses make the mistake of throwing up a form in January, capturing email addresses, and then not doing anything with people until they&#8217;ve got a brief. Most organisations don&#8217;t even know who they already have in their pool, nor are doing any work to get to know the people they&#8217;ve called to share their details, or putting in any effort retaining the trusted folk they&#8217;ve worked with in 2025.</p><p>And freelancers feel it. &#8220;Being on a bench has no relationship to getting actual work&#8221;, says one. And our feedback audits with businesses echoes similar - that most pools are both oversupplied (more freelancers than briefs), and deathly quiet between the briefs. Being &#8220;part of our pool&#8221; rarely means more than &#8220;being on a google spreadsheet&#8221;.</p><p>I believe this is the single biggest missed opportunity for businesses who want to work with freelancers. A: to build a genuine relationship with folk who can add creative, commercial and strategic value to your business; B: to reduce costs, time and effort finding people for briefs;  C: to improve reputation as a freelance friendly hirer and D: reduce risk and last minute panic by getting proactive, but doing it right.</p><p>Just &#8220;getting proactive&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough. Building a list of email addresses is not the same as building an actively engaged pool of trusted people to work with.</p><p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve built Poolside - the community support, engagement and retention plugin for your freelance pool. It&#8217;s what keeps the water warm, prevents leaks, and most importantly, nurtures the people you want to have ready, when the brief does land.</p><p>But if you&#8217;re not ready or willing to commit to community yet, there&#8217;s three very simple things you can do, before the end of the year, to start to re-engage with your existing pool (before you go out and start looking for new folk).<br><br>1. <strong>Run a freelance feedback session</strong> - gather anonymous feedback from your pool to see who is still around, how they feel about working with you, and understand your reputation (or ability to hire)<br><br>2. <strong>Host a 2025 review</strong> - share what you&#8217;ve been up to, what&#8217;s coming next year, and give your people the opportunity to raise their hands on the type of work they&#8217;re interested in collaborating on.<br><br>3. <strong>Consider your preboarding - </strong>when people sign up to join your pool, what are they really joining? How can you bring people into your culture, show them around, explain your business, and get them engaged with you, before the first brief lands? </p><p>As part of the Poolside process, we do all this with you and for you - baselining your existing pool, defining your poolboarding and alumni experience, and designing your 12 month freelancer engagement plan (which we can deliver, or you can &#8230; you choose).</p><p>But please, don&#8217;t post on LinkedIn without a plan of what to do with those 600 people who subscribed to your google form. </p><p>Because I&#8217;m confident the good ones won&#8217;t stick around for next year.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What can employers and employees learn from freelancers?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was at an

href="https://www.modeappg.co.uk/event/workstyle-reimagined-health-hiring-and-the-productivity-shift/">Modernising Employment APPG</a> event at the Houses of Commons yesterday, listening to an expert panel sharing their research and insights of the benefits of giving employees more autonomy in the workplace, including work from <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizziepenny/">Lizzie Penny</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexhirst/">Alex Hirst</a></strong> of <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hoxby/">Hoxby</a></strong>.<br><br>The self-employed are at the sharp-end of autonomy, and I think there&#8217;s a great deal which employers and employees could learn from freelancers, in unlocking the benefits, but also navigating the challenges, of autonomy at work.<br><br><strong>1/ Clarity of scope</strong> - freelancers will agree upfront what work needs to be done, and then be given the space to deliver it with excellence within a timebox. Employees often have open ended objectives that are vague, and spread over the course of a year. <br><br><strong>2/ High Value, High Impact</strong> - when busy, freelancers might be juggling multiple projects, multiple clients, so we get very good at triaging high value, high impact work, aligned to clear goals. Employees don&#8217;t always have the opportunity to choose which tasks they work on.<br><strong><br>3/ Working Context</strong> - freelancers have control over working in the places and spaces, during their most effective hours, and in the their most effective way, and have developed a good understanding of what/where/when/how they do their best work. but most employees get told how/when/where to work. <br><strong><br>4/ Balancing immediacy with longer-term</strong> - freelancers need to continually mix tasks which are important and urgent for their clients, with investment into growing their own business over time. This understanding of _sustainable_ work, not just urgent work, ensures they continue to grow over time.<br><br>More control over ones work is one of the biggest drivers of the shift to self-employment, and for the longest time, I&#8217;ve said people who are thinking about self-employment shouldn&#8217;t assume that they can&#8217;t resolve the issues in employment to see the benefits they want to explore.</p><p>Many employers are open to offering more autonomy, control over ones work, where/when/how - and offering this to employees is a clear opportunity to create business value AND keep some of your best people, who might be looking for more control in their work.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Working together to improve things.

href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/btdt-global/">BeenThereDoneThat</a></strong> to help them better understand their relationship with their network of experts.<br><br>They&#8217;re a super smart business: lean focused core, plus a curated group of world-class creative, strategic, marketing and insight specialists, who they bring together to deliver work for brands like Disney, LEGO, Google, Accenture.<br><br>So fostering strong relationships with those independent collaborators is essential, especially when it&#8217;s wrapped up into your core proposition.<br></p><blockquote><p>Working with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinkplaymake/">Matthew Knight</a></strong> to run a feedback, experience and reputation audit on our network of collaborators has proved just how transformative great feedback can be.</p><p>As a business built on the strength of our expert network, having an honest assessment of our talent pool is essential.</p><p><strong>The Independency Co.</strong>&#8216;s impartial study produced a rich report detailing gaps, risks, and actionable insights. </p><p>Now, as we gear up for annual planning, it&#8217;s helped us rethink how we shape and nurture our network based on the feedback that was shared.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Maybe you&#8217;re studio, agency, collective, recruiter, platform, or something there&#8217;s not a label for yet... Our impartial audit helps any business who has a network of freelancers or collaborators identify where they&#8217;re doing brilliantly, and where there&#8217;s room for improvement - replacing anecdote or instinct with data and evidence. <br><br>So when you&#8217;re planning next year, you can have confidence in your pool - or a project plan to make sure your pool is still engaged, active and ready to deliver award winning work with you.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keep Britain Working (or rather, employed)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Not enough focus on alternative routes to work in today's report from Government.]]></description><link>https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/keep-britain-working-or-rather-employed</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/keep-britain-working-or-rather-employed</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Knight]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 16:57:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Sf2T!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388ccc29-3f00-4350-bcc4-722d56bef119_3889x3889.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;disabled people are more likely to be self-employed than non-disabled people, often because they see it as their only viable option&#8221;</em><br><br>That&#8217;s the pretty much the only reference to self-employment in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-britain-working-review-final-report/keep-britain-working-final-report">Keep Britain Working</a> report, published today.<br><br>The intention of the report is to look at structural ways to help millions of workers who are out of work, back into work. The observation that around half of disabled people are out of work, and those who are in work find that self-employment is the only option which is possible or practical is correct.<br><br>Yet, the support infrastructure for the self-employed is non-existent.<br><br>We don&#8217;t have paid holiday, we don&#8217;t have access to statutory sick pay, we have additional risks (working before getting paid, costs to work, i.e. laptops, software, dealing with late payments), nor can many of us afford health insurance, or have a backup plan if we fall too unwell for longer periods of time. <br><br>Self-employment is a HUGE opportunity for those who cannot (for any number of reasons) re-enter the &#8220;employed&#8221; workforce.

No-one likes receiving bad feedback - but having hard evidence of what is working, and what is causing issues is essential, so you can focus on what matters most.<br><br><strong>2/ Bloated Dormancy:</strong> there&#8217;s often a mismatch between number of people in a pool, and the volume of work. perhaps the organisation went on a &#8220;finding freelancers spree&#8221;, so they have potential people should a brief come in, or perhaps they worked with people once, and haven&#8217;t again, but never formally or informally parted ways. This creates a false over-confidence in &#8220;having people we can use&#8221; and a frustration from freelancers they&#8217;ve never had work from you.<br><br><strong>3/ Tangible vs Possible:</strong> There&#8217;s a tension in asking around project availability. On the one hand, there&#8217;s lots of last minute briefing &#8220;are you available on monday?&#8221;, and on the other there&#8217;s lots of &#8220;there might be a brief&#8221; without something being confirmed. It&#8217;s a challenge for both the hirer and freelancer.<br><br><strong>4/ People beat Process:</strong> The most common positive feedback is always about specific people who make working together a positive experience. We always get feedback on specific named individuals who just made the whole thing great. Where automation might improve process, people improve relationships.<br><br>It&#8217;s no longer enough to just have a list of email addresses of people you think are waiting for a brief. <br><br>Good collaboration with good freelancers takes good design.</p><p>If you&#8217;re keen to audit your own pool, drop me a note, and we go much further than just asking. We work with businesses to help them identify how to better engage, support and retain their top freelancers too.</p><div><hr></div><p>That&#8217;s all from me<br>&#9996;&#65039; mk</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[In conversation with struggling strategists.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Key themes I'm hearing from strategists who are out of work right now.]]></description><link>https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/in-conversation-with-struggling-strategists</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/in-conversation-with-struggling-strategists</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Knight]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:24:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Sf2T!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388ccc29-3f00-4350-bcc4-722d56bef119_3889x3889.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last 12 months, I&#8217;ve spoken to... probably close to 50-60 strategists who have lost their jobs, have been freelancing for a while but all wind has been let out of their sails in a very quiet market, or are new to the role and wondering how to make progress.<br><br>I listen to each individual situation, because no-one is alike, yet there are some common themes, and I thought I&#8217;d share what I&#8217;m hearing - in the hope that a few more feel seen, heard, and less like they&#8217;re the only one experiencing this.<br><br>This isn&#8217;t a reflection on how strategy works (or doesn&#8217;t work) at the moment - there are plenty of those here already. <br><br>This is more about the human experience of people working (or not working) in the roles, and what people are feeling.<br><br><strong>1. Age/Experience</strong> - so many folk feel like they&#8217;re &#8220;aging out&#8221; of work, perhaps they&#8217;re no longer able to find roles because their experience goes against them, i.e. too expensive, too senior, just fewer roles at that level, even accused of no longer understanding culture.<br><br><strong>2. Inexperience</strong> - at the other end of the age spectrum, it&#8217;s proving to be even harder to get into junior roles, and there&#8217;s an expectation that you already should have the skills, in order to get the job.<br><br><strong>3. Generalism vs Specialism</strong> - lots of senior folk have built broader careers, with no clear throughline of one deep specialism, but a toolbox of skills (the T-shape or M-shape). Yet much hiring is looking for deep focus over broad applicability.<br><br><strong>4. Stability</strong> - so many businesses are moving to FTC models, over perm employment, which is removing any sense of stability or loyalty - whilst increasing anxiety and churn (and letting organisational knowledge walk out the door).<br><br><strong>5. Expanded responsibilities</strong> - job descriptions and requirements are ballooning, expectation on an individual looks more like what a team&#8217;s job, not just one person. And it&#8217;s burning people out. And remuneration doesn&#8217;t match.<br><br><strong>6. AI</strong> - a belief that AI is an amazing tool to accelerate strategy, not replace it - yet at the same time, a concern that the tools are providing &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and an excuse to reduce headcount.<br><br><strong>7. Lost Passion</strong> - a split here, many say they still love the job, the industry, and want to get back to having that passion for the work again - and the other half more just fed up, and looking outside of the industry to do something completely different.<br><br><strong>8. Diversification/Repositioning</strong> - lots of people recognising/actively redefining their work, their role, to be something different or adjacent. Some proactively, some enforced.<br><br><strong>9. Confidence</strong> - every day that passes, every &#8220;thanks but no&#8221;, every ghosting - leads to a little bit of confidence being chipped away at, and self-questioning.<br><strong><br>10. Connection</strong> - Most just want to have a chat, to feel some reassurance that it&#8217;s not just them - yet, it doesn&#8217;t make the situation any less challenging. I&#8217;ve heard some of the darkest stories about where people are financially and emotionally.</p><p></p><h3>What does this mean, and what can we do about it?</h3><p>This is just one tiny slice of the overall population, but in conversations with others in the industry - the overwhelming feeling for many is anxiety.</p><p>There&#8217;s a bigger conversation that needs to happen around how we treat people we hire, and how we treat them once they leave our businesses. There&#8217;s a systemic issue around how respected talent are in the creative industries generally.</p><p>There&#8217;s clearly a need to for better horizontal support - not at an employee level, but at a sector and capability level, perhaps provided by communities, by charities, by industry bodies - which invests in career long support, not just whilst you&#8217;re on &#8220;contract&#8221;. </p><p>And looking towards organisations like <a href="https://nabs.org.uk">NABS</a>, they already do a huge amount in the role of support function. But we also know how stretched charities are in terms of funding.</p><p>Communities play a role too - but often don&#8217;t have capacity to go beyond resources and peer-connection. Part of the work around the <a href="https://the.independency.co/community-coalition">Community Coalition</a> aims to maximise the small amount of resources we have to a wider group. </p><p>But that&#8217;s for freelancers, and the above conversations are not just with the self-employed. </p><p>Perhaps another coalition between strategy communities such as <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mark Pollard, Strategy Friend&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:93338124,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/266183b4-9575-4c29-a0a0-a261e89a7226_964x964.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;07b2dd67-f6de-43e1-8bb9-4e50d5fa865f&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>&#8217;s Sweathead, Kim Mackenzie&#8217;s Ladies who Strategize, <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Graeme Douglas&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:3985416,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc1bb8be-3205-4498-b261-7bc673381e72_400x400.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;82615b20-d7d1-4fce-898b-f20660a50219&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>  new whatsapp group, <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jasmine Bina&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1792248,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b276dd13-6180-4d10-a2de-12e68f076758_1280x1280.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;ea67f4da-f609-4579-8df5-50e1974af399&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> &#8217;s collective, Julian Cole&#8217;s group, <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Baiba Matisone&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:4130731,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/180b1708-7a2c-4be6-8089-16ad3be73529_864x864.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;a0171691-c415-4c54-be01-76ae34f412b7&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> &#8216;s following, etc. etc. etc. could connect in a meaningful way to provide some sort of shared pastoral support and resources for those who need it.

She then moved to Edinburgh to pursue a master&#8217;s degree in the sociology of emotion, &#8220;with a focus on how access to sex education as young people impacts our emotional health in adulthood and how comprehensive sex ed is actually a human right because it sets us up in a lot of ways moving forward with boundaries and communication.&#8221;</p><p>While in Edinburgh, Emma became deeply involved in grassroots campaigning for anti-harassment buffer zones around abortion clinics in Scotland. &#8220;Actually, that campaigning experience is where I got my first freelance job, which was doing social media for a big tampon company in London.&#8221; Over the next couple of years, she built a portfolio of around 10 brands spanning bladder care, period care, gut health, and menopause &#8212; all through word of mouth.</p><h2>The Birth of Elsie</h2><p>Emma&#8217;s path to entrepreneurship was unconventional. &#8220;In 2021, I was put in a very strange position in the UK where my degree had finished and I needed to either get a full-time job, start a business or move home, and it was completely covid so there was nobody hiring.&#8221; She chose to start a business despite never having freelanced before, initially launching a generalist platform before pivoting to focus on female and sexual healthcare.</p><p>Today, Elsie &#8212; named after a Scottish suffragette who started the first Women&#8217;s Health Hospital in Edinburgh &#8212; is her community for people who work in the sector, &#8220;building on all the pain points that I learned building my portfolio in the space.&#8221;</p><h2>A Global Community Addressing Unique Challenges</h2><p>The female and sexual healthcare sector is &#8220;super, super underfunded&#8212;it gets about 2% of VC funding,&#8221; Emma explains. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a kind of disproportionate reliance on freelance, part-time, flexible contract work.&#8221; Combined with taboo and censorship issues, this creates sector-specific pain points that general freelance communities can&#8217;t fully address.</p><p>What started with uncertain expectations has grown into a truly international community with members from over 15 countries. &#8220;People say that female sexual healthcare is niche, when actually I think it&#8217;s probably one of the most commonly pervasive topics that affects everybody.&#8221;</p><p>Emma built the community around three core pain points: &#8220;Trouble finding work, trouble building community, and lack of sector-specific upskilling.&#8221; Members get access to constantly updated channels of jobs, gigs, industry events, and research opportunities, along with monthly webinars and both virtual and in-person networking events.</p><h2>More Than Just Business</h2><p>Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Elsie is its impact on members&#8217; emotional wellbeing. After going through a major breakup in Edinburgh, Emma found herself alone in the city. &#8220;The only way that I made every single friend that I have is I went to every single networking event I could find on related topics I cared about, and I went up to people and asked them if they would like to be my friend.&#8221;</p><p>This personal experience shaped her vision for Elsie as something more than transactional. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want it to be just a job board or somewhere you visit and you get a gig and then you leave. I think there&#8217;s a direct correlation between the strength of our community and the sustainability of our business.&#8221;</p><p>Six months in, Emma conducted a survey asking what shouldn&#8217;t change as Elsie grows. &#8220;People said the way that it makes me feel. I did a sentence that said how I felt before Elsie and how I feel now that I&#8217;m here, and most people all over the world free wrote: before Elsie I felt alone and now I feel seen.&#8221;</p><p>Her hope for members is clear: &#8220;I love having that idea if you&#8217;ve got a place that no matter what happens with your work, you&#8217;re always welcome back at this space.

run a study into the wellbeing of the self-employed.</strong><br>This is our sixth year of running the study, and perhaps our most in-depth yet.</p><p>The work goes to help us shape our content, resources and influence organisations and partners we work with - whether it&#8217;s sharing with fellow freelance communities, or when we&#8217;re speaking to policy makers and government.</p><p>It&#8217;s not only a useful piece of research, but we also get lots of lovely feedback each year that it&#8217;s a helpful way to reflect upon your year - what happened, what challenges did you face, how did you experience stress during 2025?</p><p>The study is entirely anonymous, so you can speak openly and honestly - and WE NEVER EVER SHARE your data - all of the responses are aggregated into a report we publish in early 2026, but your individual data is bundled in with everyone else.</p><p>It takes a little while to complete, so pop the kettle on, make a cuppa, sit back and share how you&#8217;re you&#8217;ve been doing during 2025.</p><p>We&#8217;d also REALLY appreciate not only you taking part, but also, please share the survey with your fellow freelancers. The most people who take part, the better. Point them to: <strong><a href="https://leapers.co/research">leapers.co/research</a></strong> and we&#8217;ll do the rest!

length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interesting news from the UK this week - <a href="https://www.lewissilkin.com/insights/2025/08/21/whats-up-with-whatsapp-contracts">a case in the high court</a> - where a client agreed to something in an whatsapp message, then tried to change their mind down the line - the judge upheld the original agreement is binding.</p><p>I have, for YEARS been saying freelancers should never work without a contract, and a text message here and there, even emails, where a client agrees to something isn't sufficient - a proper written contract is essential for your protection.</p><p>I've said this because I've seen to many clients try to wiggle out of things which they casually agree to, and then later claim they didn't - and having something formally signed felt a much stronger protection.</p><p>But this ruling upholds that a whatsapp message, or other casual conversations such as a slack DM or teams chat - can be upheld as a contract, providing all of the criteria which make a contract are in place (a clear offer, an acceptance of that offer, price or scope and intent).</p><p>This is a positive for freelancers, if you've had a conversation where your client has said you've got the work over a text, and then they walk that back or claim otherwise, you are more likely to have a contract in place which you could hold them accountable.</p><p>However, contracts work both ways - if you've said you'll do something over a text too, that means you might be held to that agreement as well. </p><p>The court also upheld that "we'll send a contract later" doesn't necessarily allow you to walk back what was agreed earlier in a later formalised agreement either, and that loose ambiguous wording can trip you up too.</p><h3><strong>What does this mean for freelancers?</strong></h3><p><strong>Good thing:</strong> If a client has agreed to something in a whatsapp, email, DM or similar, and it looks like a contract, it probably is a contract, and can be legally binding - giving you more protection if they try and get out of it later.</p><p><strong>Bad thing:</strong> If you agree to something in a whatsapp, that's a contract, and might be harder to get out of later! And also, in some ways, I worry that this means more freelancers will be okay "working without a formalised contract", assuming a whatsapp is sufficient.</p><p>However, if you do have a situation where there was no contract, but you do have a conversation where things are being agreed to - you may have a better chance at having that agreement defended in court. </p><p>Of course, this only really means if you're willing to take these sort of disputes to adjudication, take legal action or similar. If you're just having an argument with a client who refuses to accept that they've agreed to something, you might still have a hard time.</p><p>So, our recommendations lie unchanged - don't work without a formalised contract, which clearly outlines:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Who&#8217;s contracting</strong> (legal names)</p></li><li><p><strong>Scope &amp; outputs</strong> (clear deliverables, what&#8217;s excluded)</p></li><li><p><strong>Fees &amp; cadence</strong> (day rate or fixed, <em>one invoice per month</em>, expenses)</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment terms</strong> (<em>net 30 days from invoice</em>, interest on late)</p></li><li><p><strong>IP &amp; usage</strong> (when rights transfer; portfolio use)</p></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality &amp; data</strong> (especially if handling client/customer data)</p></li><li><p><strong>Change control</strong> (how extras are approved and priced)</p></li><li><p><strong>Kill fee / termination</strong> (and what&#8217;s payable)</p></li><li><p><strong>Notices</strong> (where official notices/invoices must be sent)</p></li></ol><p>If a client is pushing to agree things in Whatsapp, encourage them to move over to email and sign things via a document, not chat, and certainly not a phonecall! If you must negotiate in DMs, prefix with <strong>&#8216;subject to contract&#8217;</strong> and move swiftly to a signed document.</p><p>Get into the habit of getting contracts in place for every project - a couple of hours of effort can save many days of headache down the line.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.freelancing.support/resources/guide-to/contracts/">longer resource on contracts</a> over here, for signposting to what you should be including in a contract, and examples of boilerplate or templates you can build upon.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Freelancers, Wanted - a new research series.]]></title><description><![CDATA[As more people turn to freelancing, whether by choice or find themselves in it - are businesses also thinking about the seismic shift that's going to happen, or are they lagging behind, and might struggle to make the most of it?]]></description><link>https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/freelancers-wanted-a-new-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/freelancers-wanted-a-new-research</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Knight]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 15:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Sf2T!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388ccc29-3f00-4350-bcc4-722d56bef119_3889x3889.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more people turn to freelancing, whether by choice or find themselves in it - are businesses also thinking about the seismic shift that's going to happen, or are they lagging behind, and might struggle to make the most of it?<br><br>We know we will see more project driven work, over open-ended employment.

This is what I mean by it.</p><p>The open marketplaces removed friction when looking for freelancers - it was seen a good thing for both sides, easier to find a freelancers, easier for a freelancer to find work.</p><p>However, just as dating apps created a &#8220;there will always be someone better&#8221;, slightly different to the &#8220;optimal stopping problem&#8221;, it created the sense of &#8220;always being someone waiting for work&#8221;.</p><p>And this commoditised working with freelancers. </p><p>If you know there&#8217;s an infinite supply of something, there&#8217;s no scarcity, and therefore no value. </p><p>And in freelancing, this manifests as treating freelancers without respect, because of the assumption there will always be someone who is willing to put up the situation.</p><p>Additionally, there&#8217;s a &#8220;nanosecond decision making&#8221; problem that further makes matters worse, that there&#8217;s a long list of people to chose from, you&#8217;re going to swipe swipe swipe, glance glance glance, and choose quickly - without really considering.</p><p>This means that people are being selected based upon being a) at the top of a deck (algorithm or salience) b) being available c) ticking boxes at a capability level, rather than an experience and chemistry level.</p><p>This makes it harder for those who aren&#8217;t on the top of the deck to get work, and removes any process for stopping and thinking whether they&#8217;re a good fit on other criteria. It&#8217;s &#8220;hot or not&#8221; over &#8220;right or not&#8221;.</p><p>Friction is a good thing. Taking some time to filter through a pool of people, and consider who is right for a role is a good thing. No, we shouldn&#8217;t do it on every job - the point of building a relationship with a trusted pool of freelancers is that you don&#8217;t need to do it every time, you&#8217;re building intelligence on who is good for what.</p><p>But you do need to do it at some point.</p><p>Otherwise you&#8217;ll be on the apps forever, with a long stream of dreadful first dates.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Independent Community Coalition]]></title><description><![CDATA[A new collective

However, it&#8217;s often messy. Teams are stretched, and the reality of not having people on the team hits hard and fast, leading to last minute briefs and shout-outs on LinkedIn to look for people.</p><p>The old model of "brief on a friday, hope they're around on monday" doesn't, nor has ever worked - and only ends up with poorer experience for freelancer and hirer.</p><p>So there&#8217;s a number of things which progressive businesses can take the opportunity to consider now, especially with regards to strategy:<br><br><strong>1) Set out your stall</strong> - develop a clear ambition and role for how you're looking to work with strategy freelancers and independent partners. Do you use them to react to incoming briefs? Do you use them to scale up expertise? Do you use them to create confidence in areas you don't have expertise?<br><br><strong>2) Build a bench</strong> - don't wait for the brief, start to reach out to people you've worked with before, or get recommendations of new people, and start chatting to them NOW. Do a chemistry, capability and commercial check. Sort out all your compliance and contract nonsense now, so they're ready to go later. It's also worth auditing your existing bench of freelancers - are they still around? Do they still want to work with you?<br><br><strong>3) Add a half-day of preboarding</strong> - get them up to speed on your company, process, models, products, language, chat to your team, whatever double-diamond or figure of eight you use, so they're ready to integrate into your way of working. One agency's "Brand Platform" is another's "Big Idea".<br><br><strong>4) Don't brief and forget</strong> - invite them into your alumni programme, to keep your best freelance talent closer. Engage your community and network, so they're more likely to be around for the next brief.<br><br><strong>5) Build network intelligence</strong> - don't just think about capabilities, cost and availability. Think about background, experience, passions, interests, culture, and build tools to match your people to your briefs. Use AI for the busywork and people intel, not the strategy.</p><p></p><p>This model works well for all freelancers, not just strategists, but building a bench, if you&#8217;ve already got a strong alumni doesn&#8217;t make sense. Auditing and reviewing your existing pool, and re-engaging the top talent saves &#163;2k+ per head per project, so start there.<br><br>The coming 6-12 months is going to get harder to find good people, because there are going to be SO many people applying to your posts. Get ahead of the noise. And if you need some help building and engaging your virtual strategy network, you know where we are.</p><p></p><h2>Other news.</h2><p>We&#8217;ve just produced the first &#8220;Freelance Feedback&#8221; report for a business. They polled their pool, and scored 73/100, which is excellent - scoring highly across experience, reputation and relationship. The report has helped them to identify a number of key areas for improvement, with an opportunity to save upwards of &#163;40,000 over the next 12 months. </p><p>The <a href="https://the.independency.co/freelance-feedback/get">Freelance Feedback audit is now available</a> for organisations with freelance pools of 30 and above. </p><p>---------</p><p>We were at the Mind UK Mental Health at Work Leadership Council meeting this week, representing freelancers towards government and employers. We&#8217;ve fed into a new piece of research work to ensure people taking part are accurately describing how they work, especially with regards to &#8216;multiple employers&#8217;, as most freelancers have.</p><p>---------</p><p>We held the inaugural Community Coalition meeting this month, with 10 community organisations represented, coming together to create a more connected and collective voice for freelancers. More to come on this over the rest of the year.</p><p>---------</p><p>Outside Perspective - our community for freelance strategy folk has opened its doors to those facing redundancy, to provide additional support and guidance to anyone unsure about how to step into self-employment.

Skilled. Diverse. These are all essential, and massively underdelivered at the moment within the sector. We know from research from bodies like The Film &amp; TV charity or the work which Leapers does that mental health is a significant challenge, and a multiplier effect is in place when self-employed. We know across many sectors in employment, training and development is underinvested, and in self-employment, access to affordable training and development is even harder. And diversity - again poor in employment, but even more shocking levels of discrimination in self-employment. So all key points which need addressing.</p><p>(Of course, resilience isn&#8217;t really the issue here - it&#8217;s changing the environment in which we work, so we don&#8217;t need to be resilient.

Beyond the immense task of listening to the broad set of voices, what are their priority and focus likely to be?</p><p>Here&#8217;s my view on the most pressing challenges our industry might be facing, through the lens of a freelancer and working with freelancers.</p><p><strong>1/ Contracts and Payments</strong></p><p>Too many freelancers work without fair contracts and get paid unfairly or late. Requiring clear and fair contracts should be law, and stricter penalties for late payers to sole, small and microbusinesses is essential. Late payment is a massive issue, but the most common snagging point around late-payments is lack of clarity around contractual terms, so these need to be dealt with, hand in hand.</p><p><strong>2/ Complexity of status, rights and taxation</strong></p><p>IR35 naturally will be high on people&#8217;s agendas for change, but I don&#8217;t expect it to be an area of focus. However, simplification and alignment around taxation and rights when it comes to worker status is essential. Whether the freelance champion is in the right position to push for this, we shall see, but the complexity and lack of clarity around this is massive, for both hirers and freelancers.</p><p><strong>3/ Discrimination, bullying, harassment.</strong></p><p>Stronger guardrails, clear paths for escalation, arbitration and better signposting and support for freelancers encountering major issues when working with hirers. There is rarely any route for complaint, or right to reply. An independent body (perhaps the OSBC) to deal with issues, and investment in to resources and support lines (via charities or similar) needs to be in place. And dealing with the organisations who are repeat offenders, to hold them more to account.</p><p><strong>4/ Mental health</strong></p><p>Better signposting to good quality resources, support and infrastructure for mental health of the self-employed. Investment in to developing services which are made available to those registered as self-employed, tax-breaks on accessing therapy or healthcare for small businesses.</p><p><strong>5/ Pricing and Cartels</strong></p><p>More action taking against businesses who collude to drive down pricing and day rates for the self-employed, and tax breaks for businesses who invest in SME suppliers over larger businesses.</p><p><strong>6/ Pensions, Insurance, Mortgages, Sick Pay, Parental Leave and Holiday Pay</strong></p><p>Tax breaks and incentives for self-employed individuals to be able to invest in pensions, insurance, mortgages, and optional schemes to support sick pay and parental leave pay for freelancers. Equal rights to SSP and Parental Leave for the self-employed. Enforce hirers to pay pension contributions and holiday pay if freelancers deemed to be workers or on PAYE and via umbrellas, rather than no-rights-employment. Allow hirers to pay benefits and contributions to rest, wellbeing and learning and development, without being at risk as seen as an employee.</p><p><strong>7/ Accessible access to education and training</strong></p><p>Investment in affordable and accessible training for those new to self-employment and those established in self-employment, to develop new skills. Allow training in new disciplines to be tax-deductible.</p><p><strong>8/ Clear accountability within hirers for freelancers</strong></p><p>In the same way we have a DPO role in most businesses, a named individual who is responsible for the rights and fair treatment of freelancers within a business, who is responsible for reporting on working practises, diversity, day rates, payment timing, etc. And published reporting for larger businesses, or those who hire over 50 freelancers in a year.</p><p>I&#8217;d also make ghosting illegal, but that&#8217;s probably harder to enforce.</p><p><strong>There&#8217;s so much more that we could be looking at though - what are the most pressing issues you&#8217;d want a freelance champion to be tackling?</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m going to be working with a number of the freelance communities over the coming weeks to try and create a &#8216;coalition of communities&#8217; so it&#8217;s a little easier for government to listen to more of us, as I recognise it&#8217;s going to be such a huge challenge, listening to the 2m odd freelancers in the UK, in a consistent fashion.</p><p>If you&#8217;re a community leader, drop me note.</p><p>If you&#8217;re working with freelancers and want to know what you can do to help, drop me a note.</p><p>Anything we can do collectively, as freelancers and those who work with freelancers, to help each other be heard, the time is now.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three Cs.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why it's not just about compliance and cost.]]></description><link>https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/three-cs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://theindependencyco.substack.com/p/three-cs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Knight]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:42:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388ccc29-3f00-4350-bcc4-722d56bef119_3889x3889.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I talk to folk in the freelance recruitment and management industry, they say the most pressing themes being discussed are:</p><p></p><p>COMPLIANCE</p><p>&amp;</p><p>COST</p><p></p><p><strong>Compliance</strong> - It&#8217;s all about making sure you&#8217;re not falling foul of IR35, contracting, employment law, etc.</p><p>There&#8217;s so much complexity and confusion, they just want it resolved, so they can do the work with brilliant freelancers.</p><p>So there&#8217;s loads of platforms who are focusing on compliance. Tick.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cost</strong> - Freelancers are seen as expensive, and often sit on a different budget line to employees. So it looks like a high cost per day, despite being more productive, more specialised and cost effective.</p><p>But cost base is important to all businesses. So there&#8217;s loads of platforms who are focusing on track and manage cost. Tick.</p><p></p><p>But what about the freelancers?</p><p>What about the &#8220;commodity&#8221; that all of this is supposedly meant to be managing, optimising, leveraging?</p><p>Cost and Compliance are wholly internally facing concerns - and finance and legal concerns - not even a concern about quality, creativity, impact, or even ROI.</p><p>Only focusing on INTERNAL metrics (cost and compliance) ignores the core thing you&#8217;re trying to do, work well with EXTERNAL people.</p><p>No Tick.</p><p></p><p>So, I&#8217;m adding a third C, which hirers need to start thinking about. Community. Connection. Cohesion. Communication. Collaboration.</p><p>If you&#8217;re not investing in the experience of working with you, not building relationships, and looking to retaining your best&#8230;</p><p>Compliance gets more complex.</p><p>Cost goes up.</p><p>ROI goes down.</p><p></p><p>I&#8217;ve spoken about the commercial value of retention strategies before. This is all part of the same concern. If you&#8217;re only looking at risk (compliance) and cost (optimisation), you&#8217;re not thinking about quality or ROI.</p><p>Hirers will need to shift to considering the ROI of their relationships with their freelancers, not just the direct impact on the P&amp;L.</p><p>It&#8217;s one of the reasons we&#8217;re starting with <a href="https://the.independency.co/freelance-pool-feedback.html">Freelance Feedback</a> - if you don&#8217;t know where the issues lie, you&#8217;re losing your most expensive asset: talent. Hiring costs too much, so re-using trusted talent is essential. But if they&#8217;re walking out of the door after each project, you&#8217;re just throwing good money after bad.</p><p>All the rest comes once you know where the issues

for independent workers.<br><br>More and more indies are setting themselves up as &#8220;<em><strong>microstudios</strong></em>&#8221;, over working as individuals, investing in commercial brand over personal positioning.<br><br>To me, this makes sense:<br><strong><br>1) microstudios can easily scale to offer a team</strong>, not just an individual. individuals can also do this, but there's a huge perception difference.</p><p> <br><strong>2) many want to get away from the concept of "freelancer"</strong> as it holds much baggage, and microstudios are positioned as "delivery based" rather than "time based"</p><p><br><strong>3) a microstudio is buyabl</strong>e, it has IP, process, products - a person is not. thinking about exit strategies is worthwhile, even if you don't want to</p><p><br><strong>4) it's a mindset shift -</strong> not all freelancers feel like they run a business. but most microstudios do. they have a roadmap, a vision, values and an agenda. </p><p><br><strong>5) client perception</strong> - there's still some negative vibes towards freelancers, and risk averse clients may avoid hiring a freelancer, but be more open to a microstudio, feeling liability is lower. there are also some tax liability benefits, if not providing an individual, but a service offering. <br><br>It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, and whether we see additional infrastructure to support microstudios do bigger things.<br><br>Of course, personal brand and microentity brand aren't mutually exclusive, in fact to create credibility, they often need work hand in hand, but they are distinct and play different roles.<br><br>It&#8217;s also important to say, I recognise that 'freelancers' and 'microstudios' are not interchangable concepts. Microstudios are absolutely not just a freelancer with a brand-name. They're SO much more than that, they're a clear idea, value proposition and service offering. Freelancers could also have that, but operating as a person vs operating as an entity are not the same mindset. There's probably a very interesting venn diagram to be drawn.</p><p>In fact, it might be useful to be clear on my definitions: </p><p><strong>Freelancer</strong> - individual working under their own name or limited company name, but you're generally hiring the named individual. May collaborate with other freelancers at times, but dominant model is working solo, or as part of a client/agency team. Can work with agencies or clients. Might also be called a contractor, especially if it's longer term work. Could be 'embedded' inside a client, time based models or delivery based models.</p><p><strong>Microstudio</strong> - individual or small partnership (1-3 people) working formally or informally together, but consistently. providing services and deliverables, rather than time based or on-site work. may often have a wider network of less frequent collaborators. Generally the partnership is made up of practitioners - ie. the people actually doing and delivering the work, not admin/machinery/bizdev, etc. More commonly working directly with clients, but can provide services to agencies too. </p><p><strong>Collective</strong> - a business providing services delivered by it's curated network or community of individuals (generally freelancers), acting similarly to an agency model, but generally very few 'employed' members of the team. some expectation from the collective a flow of work or opportunities. might have some form of equity and support. Most commonly working directly, most likely competing against agencies. Often the central function might be more bizdev/pm, and the network are the practioners, but often collectives might have a specialism at its heart, which the collective founders might be specialists in.</p><p><strong>Communities</strong> - an organisation providing support and peer-connection between individuals. May have a jobs board, but delivering work as an entity is unlikely to be their primary purpose. May have revenue streams by charging their members, rather than clients. </p><p>There is often a blurred line between collectives and communities (i.e. collectives often have thriving communities), but the 'purpose' is the definitive aspect. </p><p>Communities exist to support and connect members (and may also provide work).</p><p>Collectives exist to provide work to clients (and may also support members).</p><div><hr></div><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335607612949872641/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7335607612949872641%2C7335648892568444930)&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7335648892568444930%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7335607612949872641)&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A(7335649540974256128%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7335607612949872641)&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A7335607612949872641%2C7335649540974256128)">I posted this observation</a>, and had a few useful builds:</p><p><strong>1/ The importance of having a team</strong> - having a consistent group of people you can work with, build with, lean upon - it&#8217;s transformative. It&#8217;s probably the biggest challenge in self-employment, the over-reliance upon building a business all on your own. It&#8217;s exhausting. Having others to do this with, is powerful.</p><p>Allyson Carroll - an independent strategist commented: &#8220;Adding expertise from other areas has given me new energy and helped me remember that I'm strongest and most creative within a team, even a tiny one.&#8221;</p><p>The point around energy is so so crucial to understand as a small business owner, and when the self-employed are more likely to face issues around burnout and exhaustion, as well as isolation and mental health challenges, others having your back on the days where you&#8217;re not feeling it - is critical.</p><p><strong>2/ Self-promotion suck</strong>s - not everyone enjoys marketing, and finds self-promotion a little cringy. Promoting a product, service or brand just feels easier. Joe Daniels, positioning-specialist-supremo commented: &#8220;A lot of freelancers HATE the idea of self-promotion. Promoting a brand that isn't just you feels a little less icky.&#8221;</p><p><strong>3/ Commercial Clout</strong> - acting as a business can also unlock mindset shifts, and prevent clients setting day rates. Tash Peshkin, founder of multiple agency model businesses, explains &#8220;For most I imagine it&#8217;s driven by a desire to leap frog the crazy competition for agency work. And set your own prices (ie consume some of the end agency margins).&#8221;. </p><p><strong>4/ Clients with Benefits</strong> - Matthew Mottola, leading voice in the world of independent work, points out there are benefits for clients too: &#8220;I love this concept because it&#8217;s easy to scale outcomes up/down. Makes things like classification, guest access (the boring stuff) complicated, but we&#8217;ve seen them be really powerful!&#8217;</p><p>President of collective Model b Chris Perkins, explains the opportunity in the models: &#8220;With clients facing enormous financial performance pressures, they are increasingly receptive to these newer talent access models. As long as clients don&#8217;t have to supervise or direct different teams and the NDA/operating agreement/contract is managed by the lead agency, they love it once they give it a shot.&#8221;</p><p>I think collectives and microstudios offer different benefits, but there is undoubtedly more choice today than ever before for clients hiring talent.</p><p>However, does it make things more complex or simpler?</p><p>Clients are already confused by IR35, who they can and cannot hire, the risks around taxation and classification. Does working with a microstudio make it even harder?</p><p>In lots of ways microstudios as business entity, rather than individual (or PSC) removes so much of the complexity, as it&#8217;s a simple B2B relationship. No individuals, deliverables based and even supports substitution. </p><p>And beyond that, they have a single point of contact, over managing multiple freelancers in a team, and perhaps most importantly - the cost of working with a microstudio working directly with practitioners, compared to a large agency, with overheads, layers of management and inflated costs - the ROI is high.</p><p>There will, undoubtedly still be some concerns around working with a smaller business. Reputation, reliability, risk. So it&#8217;s on the microstudio to ensure they can solve the trust hurdle. </p><p>But with the portfolio of work from some recently launched studios I&#8217;ve seen, as talented freelancers combine with very impressive lists of brands and work already done directly - that should be a small challenge to tackle.</p><p>They&#8217;re the supergroups of the 1970s, in the context of the independent landscape of the 2020s.</p><p>Perhaps more businesses will wake up to the benefits of partnering with microstudios.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
