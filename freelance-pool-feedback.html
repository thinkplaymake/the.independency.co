                <strong>Leaky talent pools are costly.</strong><br/>
                Replacing a trusted freelancer can cost upwards of £2,500 — in search time, onboarding drag, and delivery risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>And freelancers who had a bad experience?</strong><br/>
                96% will tell others to avoid you, damaging your reputation and making future hires harder and more costly.

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
                <h3>Why run a FERRI audit?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most organisations don’t know how freelancers actually experience working with them.</br>
                    As a result, they lose great talent, damage their brand, and waste money fixing it later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>A twice-yearly check lets you:</strong>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Spot and fix issues early</li>
                    <li>Improve rebooking rates</li>
                    <li>Protect your freelancer reputation</li>
                    <li>Strengthen your freelancer ROI and commercial performance</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why not ask them yourself?</h3>

                <p>
                    Because they won’t tell you the truth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an independent third party -  we are able to gather impartial and anonymous insights from your freelancers, so they can be honest without fear of judgement.
                </p>

                <p></p>
                    And we’re building a benchmark across many hirers, so you can see how you’re doing within your industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Only FERRI gets the real picture —<br/>
                    not just what you want to hear.
